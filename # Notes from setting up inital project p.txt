# Notes from setting up inital project portfolio 

# Step 1
Create github repo and name (benzwiener/portfolio.io), enable pages, make it public 

# Step 2 
Create a starter page (index.html, code taken form perplexity.ai suggestion), turn it into a live page with the following commands (also install git first). Post these from terminal while folder in VScode is open

    # Creates git repo in the folder and the first "commit" 
    git init
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "Initial portfolio page" 

    # renames code to main (commonly used and expected in github)
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

    # Push commands to github
    git push -u origin main

then in github go to repo settings->pages and choose branch:main, folder:root and save changes 

# Side Step
    # Tells git your username and email and then helps to connect your git account to github
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
